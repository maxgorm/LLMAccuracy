Manually fix JSON output with rules based approach

Run RRs in batches to avoid token limit, then reconstruct batch outputs
Make it dynamic to work with all fields

Convert Excel files to PDFs

# API Usage
The API-based verifier requires:
1. A valid API endpoint (set in the app or via prompt)
2. API key (if required by the service)
3. Set page size to 10,000 to avoid pagination (already implemented)
